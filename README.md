ZFS Volume snapshotter plugin for [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd).

## Getting started

Zvol snapshotter is implemented as a proxy plugin daemon. You will need to create a zfs pool or dataset to be used for snapshots, run the zvol snapshotter daemon and update the containerd configuration.

- Update containerd config file which by default is located at `/etc/containerd/config.toml`.

    ```toml
    # Plug zvol snapshotter into containerd
    # Containerd recognizes zvol snapshotter through the specified socket address.
    # The specified address below is the default which zvol snapshotter listens to.
    [proxy_plugins]
      [proxy_plugins.zvol]
        type = "snapshot"
        address = "/run/containerd-zvol-grpc/containerd-zvol-grpc.sock"
    ```

- Create ZFS dataset.

    The dataset name is arbitrary, pick whatever you want.

    ```sh
    sudo zfs create your-zpool/snapshots 
    ```
- Run  zvol snapshotter daemon.

    ```sh
    containerd-zvol-grpc -dataset your-zpool/snapshots
    ```
## Build zvol snapshotter from source

Checkout the source code using git clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weltei/zvol-snapshotter.git
cd zvol-snapshotter
```

`make` is used as the build tool. Assuming you are in the root directory build the snapshotter by running:

```sh
make
```

The snapshotter binary is build into the `./out` directory. Install to a `PATH` directory with:

```sh
sudo make install
# check to make sure the Zvol snapshotter can be found in PATH
sudo zvol-snapshotter-grpc -version
```

The binary is installed in `/usr/local/bin` by default. Set `CMD_DESTDIR` to change the destination.
