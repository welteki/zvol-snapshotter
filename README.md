ZFS Volume snapshotter plugin for [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd).

## Install

Zvol snapshotter is implemented as a proxy plugin daemon. To use Zvol snapshotter you will need to create a zfs pool or dataset to be used for snapshots, run the Zvol snapshotter daemon and register the snapshotter plugin with containerd.

### Requirements

- [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) >= 1.4
- ZFS - On ubuntu it can be installed with `sudo apt install zfsutils-linux`

### Create a ZFS dataset

Create a ZFS dataset that will be used for snapshots. The dataset name is arbitrary, pick whatever you want.

```sh
sudo zfs create your-zpool/snapshots 
```

### Run snapshotter daemon

You can download prebuilt binaries for the snapshotter from the [release page](https://github.com/welteki/zvol-snapshotter/releases) or [build them from source](#build-zvol-snapshotter-from-source).

```sh
version="0.0.2"
arch="amd64"

wget https://github.com/welteki/zvol-snapshotter/releases/download/v${version}/zvol-snapshotter-${version}-linux-${arch}.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin \
  -xvf zvol-snapshotter-${version}-linux-${arch}.tar.gz zvol-snapshotter-grpc
```

**Run snapshotter**

```sh
sudo containerd-zvol-grpc -dataset=your-zpool/snapshots
```

**Run snapshotter as a systemd service**

To run the Zvol snapshotter process as a systemd service you can download the [zvol-snaphsotter.service unit file](https://github.com/welteki/zvol-snapshotter/blob/main/scripts/config/zvol-snapshotter.service) into `/etc/systemd/system/zvol-snapshotter.service`.

After saving the service file, you can start the service with the usual systemctl dance:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable zvol-snapshotter
```

### Configure containerd

Configure and restart containerd to enable Zvol snapshotter. (this section assumes your containerd is managed by systemd)

- Update containerd config file which by default is located at `/etc/containerd/config.toml`.

    ```toml
    # Plug zvol snapshotter into containerd
    # Containerd recognizes zvol snapshotter through the specified socket address.
    # The specified address below is the default which zvol snapshotter listens to.
    [proxy_plugins]
      [proxy_plugins.zvol]
        type = "snapshot"
        address = "/run/containerd-zvol-grpc/containerd-zvol-grpc.sock"
    ```
- Restart containerd: `sudo systemctl restart containerd`
- Check to make sure Zvol snapshotter is recognized by containerd: `sudo ctr plugin ls id==zvol`

### Run

Try out the snapshotter with the following command:

```sh
ctr images pull --snapshotter zvol docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
ctr run --snapshotter zvol docker.io/library/hello-world:latest test
```

## Configuration

The Zvol snapshotter has a toml config file that is located at `/etc/zvol-snapshotter-grpc/config.toml` by default. If such a file does not exist, Zvol snapshotter will use default values for all configurations.

Example configuration:

```toml
root_path="/var/lib/containerd-zvol-grpc"
dataset="your-zpool/snapshots"
volume_size="20G"
fs_type="ext4"
```

The following configuration settings are available:

- `root_path` - Snapshotter root directory for metadata.
- `dataset` - ZFS dataset that will be used for snapshots.
- `volume_size` - Space to allocate when creating volumes.
- `fs_type` - File system to use for snapshot device mounts. (Currently only ext4 is supported)

## Build Zvol snapshotter from source

Checkout the source code using git clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weltei/zvol-snapshotter.git
cd zvol-snapshotter
```

`make` is used as the build tool. Assuming you are in the root directory build the snapshotter by running:

```sh
make
```

The snapshotter binary is build into the `./out` directory. Install to a `PATH` directory with:

```sh
sudo make install
# check to make sure the Zvol snapshotter can be found in PATH
sudo zvol-snapshotter-grpc -version
```

The binary is installed in `/usr/local/bin` by default. Set `CMD_DESTDIR` to change the destination.
